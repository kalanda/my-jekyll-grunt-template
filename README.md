# my-jekyll-grunt-template

This is a projects template for frontend developments using Jekyll and Grunt. Two options are available to install. You can install using Vagrant or install it locally. Go forward in this document to see how. 

After the installation of either of the two options, you can run `grunt serve` for development mode and visit your app at [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000). This will watch your files for changes and automatically rebuild and reload in the browser.  

Also you can run `grunt build` to build a minified and optimized version into the `/dist/` directory.


## 1. Install using Vagrant

1. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
2. Then [download the template project](https://github.com/kalanda/my-jekyll-grunt-template/archive/master.zip) and unzip to some folder.
3. Open a terminal window and go to the new folder with `cd /path/to/folder`
4. Run `vagrant up` and take a coffee (or two). Don't care about red text and just wait the script to finish installing and provisioning the Vagrant box.
5. Run `vagrant ssh` to access the box 
6. Run `cd /vagrant`
6. Now you can use `grunt serve` or `grunt build`

## 2. Install locally

---

Before start you have to install:

* [RybyGems](https://rubygems.org/)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

First, install Grunt and Bower globally:

	$ npm install -g grunt-cli
	$ npm install -g bower

Clone this repository:

	$ git clone https://github.com/kalanda/my-jekyll-grunt-template.git

Change into the new directory:

	$ cd my-jekyll-grunt-template

Install Bundler (see troubleshooting below if you are using OSX El Capitan):

	$ sudo gem install bundler

Now run clean and install script:
	
	$ ./clean.sh
	$ ./install.sh
	
## Troubleshooting

### NOTE ONLY for users with OSX 10.11 El Capitan **

OSX 10.11 has a new security feature named "CSR" which protect integrity of some system paths. If you get a message like *"Operation not permitted - /usr/bin/bundle"* when installing Bundler in local you have to disable CSR or maybe use the Vagrant option because is isolated from your system.

To disable CSR:

  1. Boot into the Recovery HD by restarting whilst holding âŒ˜R.
  2. Open Terminal (from the Utilities menu).
  3. Run the following command in Terminal: `csrutil disable`
  4. Restart.
